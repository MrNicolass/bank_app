> [!NOTE]
>This app is being developed for study and exemplification of development with Flutter/Dart. It is worth mentioning that this app is not to be used for commercial purposes.

It aims to develop an application inspired by a digital banking institution. Its screens are aimed at a modern, simple and refined style, seeking rounded edges, agility in screen transitions (few loading screens and pre-loaded elements) and concentration of buttons and menus on a few screens, always maintaining organization and practicality.

The scope is an application of a digital bank, whose mockup is authored by the Company/Bank <a href="https://www.c6bank.com.br/"  target="_blank"> C6 Bank </a>:

## How to run the project

- Make sure that the Flutter is in version 3.19.4 and Dart in version 3.3.2;
- Import the project to your preferred IDE (I am using Android Studio Giraffe | 2023.2.3);
  - Make sure the IDE has the Flutter and Dart plugins installed in the versions mentioned above;
- Go to `File > Settings > Languages & Frameworks > Flutter` and enter the path of the Flutter SDK folder in `Flutter SDK path`;
- Open the `pubspec.yaml` file and click on `pub get`, so that the dependencies (packages) used in the project are loaded;
- Execute the application.
